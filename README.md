## Pioneer Chess AI
A simple UCI chess engine inspired by Sebastian Lague's coding adventure series  
Pioneer uses the UCI protocol there is no GUI

### Todo
- Prune a lot more
- More complex evaluation function
- Time management

Note: `go` doesn't support wtime, or btime (yet)

If you would like to compile yourself, read the compile.txt, I'm working on a make file
